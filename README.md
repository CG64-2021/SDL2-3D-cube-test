# SDL2-3D-cube-test
Displays a 3D cube in the screen using SDL2, but there's no textures because SDL2 doesn't have triangle functions.

If you want to compile, you need to use Code::blocks and put the dll archives in the main project folder so that the IDE can compile for you.
The dlls are in the bin/Debug folder where there is an .exe file that is the program itself already compiled before.
